        absinthe: "Jacques Senaux green absinthe is a product that comes to us from Spain. This green absinthe is made by Teichenné from the original recipe of the Artemisia absinthium distillate. It is the absinthe with the lowest alcohol content with a volume of only 70%, without leaving it for all that flavour and character. It can be consumed pure but since it contains thujone molecules, it should be mixed with water. The drink in contact with water becomes cloudy and thicker, offering a pretty milky green. It can also be enjoyed by burning a piece of sugar soaked in absinthe. Very aromatic thanks to the distillation of plants typical of the Mediterranean region, it is characterized by notes of star anise, fennel and liquorice.",
        bacardi: "BACARDÍ Carta Oro rum brings together rich, soothing flavours like vanilla, buttery caramel, toasted almond and sweet banana notes balanced by the warm zest of orange peel and a light, oaky finish.",
