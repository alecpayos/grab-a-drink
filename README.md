# Grab A Drink

This is my very first project as well as attempt to make a web app.\
The code was refactored and ported to ReactJS as this was initially built\
on pure HTML, JS, CSS, as this was made for a friend specifically as a school project.
<br>

On another note, an attempt was made to attach a backend to this project,\
but I didn't have much experience with backend just yet when I made this.

## Usage

Users must first clone the repo.\
CD into the project root, then literally just do
<br>

`npm install && npm start`

Once the local server starts users should now be\
able to view and explore the project.

## Package Issues

Note that there may be issues when doing `npm install` per the instruction above.\
As of late, I have only identified one issue when installing packages.
<br>

`Error message "error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported"`

Whenever the error above shows during `npm start` users should only do
<br>

`npm audit fix --force`

The command above should be enough and resolve those package issues.
Other than that, you can look for the error in the internet.\
PS: This project is now discontinued and only be showcased as my first ever project.
<br>

**Cheers!**
